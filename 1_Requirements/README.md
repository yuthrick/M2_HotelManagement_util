# Description


This program is adapted to provide us information on reserving rooms, book an event, check the features etc. This program is untroublesome as it will serve the admin or user to be updated about the records without any strain and it is favored much by the people involved in the business sector. As we are aware of the busy and hectic schedule of business people, this Hotel management system turns out to be a great relief for them. This program definitely has a wide scope to minimize errors in the making of bills and it also limits the delay of delivering bills to the customers which can include taxes on the basis of their expenditure. . In the making of this program, the users or admins comfort and reliability is put into consideration which focuses to save one’s quality time.  This system has very least chance of data loss and we don‟t have to worry about it being damaged
In short, I have taken up this project to overcome the limitations and easily tackle the barriers of security plus add, edit, search and delete the records much effortlessly.
